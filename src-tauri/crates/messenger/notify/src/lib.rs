//! What a push is about, worked out on the phone.
//!
//! A push server sees only the outside of an event. The phone has the keys
//! and the messenger's database, so it is the phone that says who wrote,
//! what, and in which chat, and whether that chat is to be quiet. This
//! crate is that: an event in, a notice out, nothing written anywhere.
//!
//! It runs where the app does not: in a process a push started, with no
//! window and no runtime. So it opens the database read-only, takes the
//! keys as a bundle the app exported, and uses no network but one short
//! question to a relay when the push could not carry the event.
