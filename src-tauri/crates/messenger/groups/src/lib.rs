//! Groups.
//!
//! There is no server that owns a group. The group is a log of operations,
//! each made by a member who was allowed to make it, and every device
//! computes the same state from the same set of operations, whatever
//! order they arrived in.
//!
//! - `roles`: owner, admin, moderator, member, and what each may do.
//! - `op`: operations and their identity.
//! - `state`: the state of a group and how one operation changes it.
//! - `log`: the set of operations of a group, its linear order, the
//!   resulting state, and whether the current key can still be trusted.
//!
//! Everything in this crate is pure: no network, no storage, no clock.
//! Signatures are checked where operations enter (the wire layer); here an
//! operation's `author` is already known to be genuine.
