//! Links of the messenger.
//!
//! Every internal link is `veydan://<type>/<id>?<parameters>`, and this
//! crate is the only place that knows how such a text is taken apart and
//! put together. What a link of a given type means is decided by whoever
//! owns the type: a contact needs nothing but its key and lives here, a
//! group carries a secret and lives with the groups.
//!
//! - `uri`: the grammar.
//! - `kind`: the types of links there are.
//! - `contact`: the link of a person.
//! - `error`: refusals, as stable codes.
//!
//! Everything in this crate is pure: no network, no storage, no clock.
