/**
 * Receives pushes. The system starts it on its own, also when the app is
 * not running, so nothing here may count on the app's window or on its
 * runtime. What the push is about is worked out by the messenger's core,
 * loaded on its own, with the keys the app left for it; without the keys,
 * or when the core cannot say, the notification says only that something
 * came.
 *
 * Every push leaves one line in the log with its trace id, the same id the
 * server logs: what came and what was done with it, never what it said.
